## A Semantic Knowledge Complementarity based Decoupling Framework for Semi-supervised Class-imbalanced Medical Image Segmentation (CVPR 2025)
Official code for "A Semantic Knowledge Complementarity based Decoupling Framework
for Semi-supervised Class-imbalanced Medical Image Segmentation". (CVPR 2025)
# Data Preparation

- The **Synapse** dataset can be downloaded from <https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn3193805/wiki/>.

    Run ```preprocess.py``` to convert ```.nii.gz``` files into ```.npy```.

- The **AMOS** dataset can be downloaded from <https://amos22.grand-challenge.org/Dataset/>.

    Run  ```preprocess_amos.py``` to convert ```.nii.gz``` files into ```.npy```.

- The format of the preprocessed data is ```.npy``` with a size of ```80×160×160```. We will upload the preprocessed data as soon as possible.

    The preprocessed Synapse dataset has been uploaded to <https://pan.baidu.com/s/1TO9-PE4ZkjPMdw_QPIVSPQ?pwd=zae8>
  
- The data splits have been uploaded to the codebase.

# Training
When training on the Synapse dataset, we conducted 3 experiments with random seeds of ```0```,```1```,```666``` respectively. The other hyperparameters are as follows:

```
max_epoch=1500, cps_loss='w_ce+dice', sup_loss='w_ce+dice', batch_size=2, num_workers=2, base_lr=0.3, ema_w=0.99, cps_w=10, cps_rampup=True, consistency_rampup=None
```
When training on the AMOS dataset, we conducted 1 experiment with random seeds of ```0```. The other hyperparameters are as follows:
```
max_epoch=1500, cps_loss='w_ce+dice', sup_loss='w_ce+dice', batch_size=2, num_workers=2, base_lr=0.1, ema_w=0.99, cps_w=10, cps_rampup=True, consistency_rampup=None
```
Then run ```train_skcdf.py``` to train.
# Testing
Run ```test.py``` to generate prediction results.
# Evaluating
Run ```evaluate_Ntimes.py```  to calculate average Dice and ASD.
